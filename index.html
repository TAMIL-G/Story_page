       <ul>
        <p> <i>Dhoni </i>  was born in Ranchi, Bihar (now in Jharkhand) and hails from a Hindu Rajput family to parents from Uttarakhand. He is the youngest of three children of Pan Singh and Devaki Devi. His paternal village Lwali, is in Jainti Tehsil, Lamgara block of the Almora District of Uttarakhand. His parents moved from <b> Uttarakhand to Ranchi </b> , Jharkhand where his father worked as a pump operator in junior management position in <b> MECON Colony </b> situated in Doranda area in Ranchi.[31] Unlike Dhoni, his uncle and cousins spell their surname "Dhauni".

Previously Dhoni was the goalkeeper for his DAV Jawahar Vidya Mandir school's football team, but after seeing his goalkeeping skills, coach Keshav Ranjan Banerjee, one who inspired Dhoni to be a cricketer, picked him to play cricket for his school team. His exceptional wicketkeeping skills allowed him to become the regular wicketkeeper at the Commando Cricket Club (1995â€“1998). Based on his performance at club cricket, he was picked for the 1997/98 season Vinoo Mankad Trophy Under-16 Championship, where he performed well.

From 2001 to 2003, Dhoni worked as a <b> Travelling Ticket Examiner (TTE)</b> at Kharagpur railway station under South Eastern Railway in Midnapore (W), a district in West Bengal.</p>

        <h1>International career</h1>
        <center><img src="./india dhoni.jpg" alt="" height="300px" width="300px"></center>
        <ul><h2>Start of ODI career</h2>
        <p>The Indian ODI team in the early 2000s saw Rahul Dravid as the wicket-keeper to ensure that the wicket-keeper spot didn't lack in batting talent. The team also saw the entry of <b> wicket-keeper/batsmen </b> from the junior ranks, with talents like Parthiv Patel and Dinesh Karthik (both India U-19 captains) named in the Test squads. With Dhoni making a mark in the India A squad, he was picked in the ODI squad for the Bangladesh tour in <b>2004/05 </b> . Dhoni did not have a great start to his ODI career, getting run out for a duck on debut. In spite of an average series against Bangladesh, Dhoni was picked for the <b>Pakistan ODI series </b> </p>
        <h2>2007 World Cup</h2>
        <p>!ndia unexpectedly crashed out of the World Cup after losses to <b> Bangladesh and Sri Lanka </b> in the group stage. Dhoni was out for a duck in both these matches and scored just 29 runs in the tournament. After the loss to Bangladesh in <b> 2007 Cricket World Cup </b>, the house that Dhoni was constructing in his home-town Ranchi was vandalised and damaged by political activists of  <b>JMM </b>. The local police arranged for security for his family as India exited the World Cup in the first round.</p>
        <p>Dhoni put his disappointing performances in the World Cup behind him by scoring <b>91* against Bangladesh </b>, after India were left in a tight spot earlier in the run-chase. Dhoni was declared the Man of the Match for his performance, his fourth in ODI cricket. He was also later adjudged the Man of the Series after the third game of the series was washed away. Dhoni had a good Afro-Asia Cup, scoring <b> 174 runs </b> in 3 matches at an average of 87.00, with a  <b>blitzkrieg 139 not out off 97 balls</b>, a Man of the Match innings, in the third ODI.</p>
